A little introduction: <br>
Pearos is a linux distro based on kde neon (or kubuntu or debian, more on that later), that is made to look as close to macos as possible, it's supposed to be a "successor" to the old pearos, which has been discontinued for some time, the old developer is not affiliated to the new pearos.

## Distribution mismanagement
Pearos is horribly managed, not only does it use a different distribution for the base with almost every release, it seems to switch between debian, kde neon and kubuntu. Not only does this require you to reinstall with **every** new release, but will also cause general management issues as they all have different package versions. <br>
Updating the system with `sudo apt upgrade` would/will destroy your installation by either resetting all themes or removing really _all_ branding of pearos, turning it into a kde neon/kubuntu/debian installation. <br>
<br>
## License issues
Pearos has a virtual assistant built into it, called "Piri", the backend of that [was made by me](https://github.com/axtloss/vAssistant), at first we had a special License agreement that allowed them to use my backend if they put credit in the application. However, when I published the code on github I changed the license to gplv3 and also properly told them about it. However, it took a **long** argument to make them also open source the piri source. After some they just wiped the repo and started everything again, still using my backend, but they didn't put back the gplv3 license and went without any license. I then updated the license to the nolicense v1 and they didn't update it either. After I told them about it (I've left pear since a very long time by that) they got very pissed and started mentioning "my weird license addiction". In the end they privated the original piri and made a a custom one.<br>
<br>
They use the macos icons and are making money off of it, I think that's self explanatory.<br>
<br>
## Bigoted dev
This is the biggest reason to not use pearos (in my opinion)<br>
**Warning: This part will contain screenshots with various slurs, the screenshots will be hidden, unless you actively click on the links to images.**<br>
The main dev and "founder" of pearos is a huge bigot.<br>
- [He actively uses the n-word](placeholder)
- [He activerly uses the n-word part 2](placeholder)
- [Finds transphobic "memes" funny](placeholder)
- [Uses a transphobic slur in piri (I'll talk about this a bit more)](placeholder)
- ["Gay is an offensive word for homophobes" -alexb]()
- [In the discord server they have a running "joke" about using nice car and spoilering the "ce ca" part to make it look like they said the n word](placeholder)

## Transphobic slur in piri 
This one is a special case, originally There was a [post on r/unixporn (has been deleted)](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/mqd9q2/plasmamom_can_we_have_macos_at_home/) <br>
And then there was this comment [CW: contains transphobic slur](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/mqd9q2/comment/gufyq5b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) <br>
It was true, Alexb included a slur in piri. I contacted him about that and told him to remove it and he supposedly did. But with the release of pearos monterey (after thhttps://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/mqd9q2/plasmamom_can_we_have_macos_at_home/is whole thing has happened), look what I found: <br>
[CW: transphobic slur](placeholder)
This one really annoys me because it's really just disrespectful, he includes a transphobic slur in an application of which the backend was made by a trans person. Not only did he _lie_ to me and others about having it removed, he also just continued including it in newer releases and didn't even patch it from the release that was the newest during that time. <br>

Those are all the reasons you shouldn't support/use pearos. It's a terrible experience, the main dev is a huge bigot and doesn't care about licenses
If you're wondering why you should trust me with what I said, I used to be a dev for pearos, I've made the backend for the pext installer and also developed many of the pexts. <br>
If you have other points I could add you can create a new PR or open an issue and I'll include them. <br>
For questions you can ofc open an issue. Any type of disrespectful comments (I sorta expect them because of the last topic) will be deleted.
